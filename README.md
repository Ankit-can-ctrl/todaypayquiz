Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a quiz app I built while learning React. It's got a clean interface, some cool features, and it's actually fun to use.

## What it does

- **Quiz Interface**: Shows one question at a time with 4 multiple choice options
- **Difficulty Levels**: Pick between Easy, Medium, Hard, or mix them all up
- **Timer**: Each question has a 30-second countdown - adds some pressure!
- **Scoring**: Tracks your answers and shows your final score
- **High Score**: Saves your best performance in localStorage
- **Results Page**: See which questions you got right/wrong with detailed feedback

## Features I added

- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to move between questions, 1-4 to select answers
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard support, and screen reader friendly
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional look
- **State Management**: Uses React Context API to manage quiz state

## How to run it

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to get the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Tech stack

- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling
- Local JSON data (no external API calls)

## What I learned building this

- React Context API for state management
- Custom hooks and component composition
- Accessibility best practices
- Responsive design with Tailwind
- Local storage for data persistence
- Timer implementation with useEffect

Feel free to check out the code, run it locally, or use it as a reference for your own projects. The code is pretty clean and well-commented, so it should be easy to understand and modify.
