## Data Source

The app uses a local JSON file (`src/data/questions.json`) containing 15 carefully curated quiz questions. The data structure provides:

- **Question Types**: Multiple choice questions with 4 options each
- **Categories**: Various topics including Science, Geography, History, Art, Literature, and Mathematics
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard questions
- **Randomization**: Questions and answer options are shuffled for variety on each quiz attempt

### Data Structure

The JSON file follows a consistent structure for easy maintenance and updates:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "options": ["London", "Berlin", "Paris", "Madrid"],
      "correct_answer": "Paris",
      "category": "Geography",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    }
  ]
}
```

## State Management

The app uses React Context API with useReducer for predictable state management:

### State Structure

```javascript
const initialState = {
  questions: [], // Array of quiz questions
  currentQuestionIndex: 0, // Current question position
  userAnswers: [], // User's selected answers
  score: 0, // Current score
  isLoading: true, // Loading state
  error: null, // Error state
  isQuizComplete: false, // Quiz completion flag
};
```

### Key Actions

- `SET_ANSWER`: Record user's answer
- `NEXT_QUESTION`: Navigate to next question
- `PREVIOUS_QUESTION`: Navigate to previous question
- `COMPLETE_QUIZ`: Calculate final score
